                                <h2 class="question">Where can I buy the ingredients?</h2>
                                <p>If you want to get your food as cheap as possible I suggest Aldi and Lidl most of the time and especially for vegetables. Sometimes for meat its worthwhile to check in the more expensive supermarkets as they have "discount section" where you might able to get meat cheap. For the more specialist stuff I would suggest an Ethnic supermarket (for example if its Asian sauces go to a Chinese supermarket)and if one is close. Otherwise I would suggest really big supermarkets, like a Tesco which have an aisle with these specialist sauces or spices.</p>

                                <p>Well if you want to show off your recipes here I would suggest giving us an email, or sending a letter. You can find our contact information <a href='AboutUs.html'>HERE</a> or simply click on the "About Us" in the menu.</p>

                                <p>Well are 4 guys at Dundee University who were tasked to make a website about a community so we decided to create a webpage with the focus on cheap reasonably healthy meals for students</p>

                                <h2 class='question'>I'm worried that I can't judge when meat is cooked and might give myself food poisoning</h2>
                                <p>Well if you are worried cut the meat open and it should be the same colour the whole way through. Chicken should turn white, Beef turns brown and pork turns a white with a slight pink tinge.</p>
                            </li>

                                <h2 class='question'>Where can I find more information relating to cool cheap recipes and food hygiene so I don't die of food poisoning?</h2>
                                <p>Well for good recipes I would suggest <a href='http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/cheap-and-healthy'>BBC GoodFood</a>. For food hygiene I would suggest the <a href='http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/homehygiene/Pages/Foodhygiene.aspx'>NHS</a> as they give out helpful advice on not getting ill.</p>
